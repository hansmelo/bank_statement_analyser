## Bank Statement Analyser

Cover several topics:

- “Keep It Short and Simple” (KISS)

- “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (DRY)

- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- God classes and code duplication lead to code that is hard to reason about and maintain.

- The Single Responsibility Principle helps you write code that is easier to manage and maintain.

- Cohesion is concerned with how how strongly related the responsibilities of a class or method are.

- Coupling is concerned with how dependent a class is on other parts of your code.

- High cohesion and low coupling are characteristics of maintainable code.

- A suite of automated tests increases confidence that your software is correct, makes it more robust for changes and helps program comprehension.

- jUnit is a Java testing framework which lets you specify unit tests that verifies the behaviour of your methods and classes.

- Given-When-Then is a pattern for setting up a test into three parts to help understanding of the tests you implement.
